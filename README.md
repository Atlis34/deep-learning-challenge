Module 21 Challenge

No tutor this week, so all code was written by myself, Ryan MacFarlane.  Help and guidance was provided by the Xpert Learning Assistant on the BCS website.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Four notebooks were saved.  One for the original model, and one each for each of the Optimization attempts.  I also included the requested report, titled 
'Module 21 Challenge Assignment Report.docx'.  Code was written and tested in Google Colab, as requested by the exercise.  Notebooks were then downloaded and
saved to my local repository, before being pushed back to Git.

Apologies for turning in late.

Thank you!
